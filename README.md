# Credit Card Default Prediction

This project focuses on predicting whether a credit card customer will default on their payment in the next month using supervised machine learning techniques. The problem is treated as a binary classification task, where the target variable indicates default or non-default.

## Problem Description
Credit card default prediction is an important task in financial risk management. By analyzing customer demographic information and financial behavior, machine learning models can help financial institutions identify customers who are at a higher risk of default.

## Dataset
The project uses the **Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset** obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains customer demographic data, credit limits, bill amounts, payment history, and a binary target variable indicating default status.

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Development Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas and NumPy for data processing
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation

## Project Workflow
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Train-test split
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance comparison of models

## Results
The models were evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports. Random Forest achieved the best overall performance, while Logistic Regression and SVM provided useful baseline and comparative insights.

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Run all cells in order.
3. Ensure required Python libraries are installed.
